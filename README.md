# About

BasicBlackJack is a simple, console-based BlackJack implementation that is designed to be an example of good production code.  It has been designed with extensibility in mind.  

Beyond all that, it might even be fun!  Please send all 1% of all chips bet to me via Paypal.  :)


# Getting started

1. Make sure you have java 1.6
2. git clone git://github.com/gregbayer/basicblackjack.git
3. Make sure you are in the basicblackjack directory
4. java -jar jar/BasicBlackJack.jar

Javadocs for BasicBlackJack can be found in the docs directory.
Basic JUnit tests for each class can be found in the test directory.


# Compiling BasicBlackJack

As of now, there is no build script. I've included a compiled jar to make trying BasicBlackJack as simple as possible.

If you do want to build, I recommend using eclipse.  The only dependencies are log4j (jar included in the lib directory) and JUnit 4 if you want to run the unit tests.
